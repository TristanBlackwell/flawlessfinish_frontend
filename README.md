# Flawless Finish Hair (frontend)

## About the project

Flawless finish is a recently opened hair salon that required a site to match the brand image and provide a good online presence.

The website required displaying various information regarding the salon, treatments and Wellness rooms that are rented by external companies/individuals.

A payment solution was required for allowing clients to purchase vouchers, a booking system for scheduling hair appointments and a contact form in the event of customers having questions to the business.

Strapi CMS is used for editing content live quickly and efficiently
